# Hello there!
This repository was created for the publication of laboratory works in the discipline "Object-oriented programming and design".

## For lecturer
All labs have been and will be written in Java, in a program from JetBrains - **InteliJ IDEA Ultimate**. Java version - **Amazon Corretto 1.8**. **I’ll say right away that the laboratory work was not tested on other code editors**

## For students
My Git is public, if something doesn’t work out for you, then you can see how I implement the method/class with which you are having problems. **But under no circumstances copy the code. Remember that you are learning for yourself, not for someone else.**
